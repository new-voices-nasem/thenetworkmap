The broad goal of the Sport Research Lab is to make athletes* measurably better, and her team focuses on how Nike can create products and services that amplify and augment human performance for athletes of all abilities.\nPrior to joining Nike, Dr. Sheets-Singer was an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. She received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of CA, Davis, and was Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University. In these roles, Dr. Sheets-Signer used experimental approaches and computer simulation, modeling, and optimization to research topics including: optimal gymnastics performance, landing dynamics, tennis serve technique, dynamics of throwing with a lacrosse stick, and quantifying human and animal motion using markerless tracking techniques.   \nSheets-Singer is a recipient of the Andrzej Komor New Investigator Award from the International Society of Biomechanics, Technical Group on Computer Simulation for her work related to optimizing gymnastics performance. Additionally, Dr. Sheets-Singer was an invited speaker at the 2012 Japan America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering.",

      "": "The impact of my work is often amplified by serving and mentoring the next generation of scientists. To this end I have taken advantage of a number of opportunities via the AAAS and local communities to serve as a judge and screener in a variety of competitions and conferences, including the Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM (AAAS/NSF), the AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards, the Student Poster Competition at the AAAS Annual Meeting, and the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (NIH), among others. In the summer of 2014 I taught anatomy and physiology at the W.E.B. DuBois Scholars Institute at Princeton University. In 2012-13 I was a tutor in the Top Honors program, a non-profit organization that provides free math tutoring to 6th, 7th, and 8th grade NYC middle school students who struggle with fundamental math skills. Previously, as a New York Academy of Science (NYAS) Education Fellow at P.S./I.S. 217 on Roosevelt Island in 2011-2012, I taught 4th through 6th graders basic genetics using hands-on experiments and demonstrations. My outreach experiences reflect my drive to reach underserved communities that lack resources and effective science instruction and mentorship. In 2012 I was induced into the Edward A. Bouchet Honor Society, which advocates for students who have been traditionally underrepresented in the academy and seeks to promote diversity and excellence in doctoral education and the professoriate. While a National Academies Mirzayan fellow in 2009, I was participant on the Committee for Science, Technology, and Peacebuilding at the U.S. Institute of Peace and on the Responsible Conduct of Research Educational Committee at the Council of Graduate Schools, providing to each the ‘early career’ perspective of a freshly-minted science Ph.D. with an interest in broader social questions concerning the relationship between the scientific enterprise and the public."
